Welcome to my to-do list!

Purpose:

To provide a neat and consolidated list of all the things you need to do in the near future.

To Use:

1. Type the task/chore you need to complete in the input field next to the 'Add New' button.

2. Click on the 'Add New' button.

3. To check off your task, click on the task. (Note that it turns green. Hooray!)

4. To uncheck your task, click on the task again. (Note that it turns red again. Aww...)

5. To delete the task from the list, click on the 'X' button next to the task. There is no confirmation! (yet?)
